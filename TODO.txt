ADD - "Latest visitors"
log users that have viewed your account. We need to create a new "events" or "logs" db table for this.

ADD - "You might like" function
showing results based on age, location and sexual orientation

ADD - "You recently visited"
log profiles you have visited. We can use the same table as for "latest visitors"

ADD - "Favorite profiles"
you'll be able to tag users as "favorite", making it so you can easily access their profile.
The user that was tagged will be able to view who tagged them, unless the tagger explicitly says
not to do this.

ADD - "Recent activity"
we can use the "events/logs" table for this. Will show the latest updates ex: if user updated his mood status,
his "about me" description, changed/added pictures etc.

ADD - "Who's online"
we need to be able to fetch online users and to show if someone's online on their profile and such.
time period 5-15 min from last activity.

ADD - "Who's online to front page"
generic profiles if not logged in & matching location profiles if logged in.

ADD - "Show mood status updates on the front page"

ADD - "Chat feature"
Ryan is going to do this using node.js, he already has the whole thing figured out and working.
